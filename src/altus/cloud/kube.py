"""Kubeconfig discovery and context selection.

**By default nothing here writes to the user's kubeconfig.** Listing contexts
reads the file; selecting one records the choice in Altus's own state, because
changing the global context as a side effect of a chat message would silently
retarget every other terminal the user has open.

``set_current_context`` is the opt-in exception, reached only when
``[cloud] kube_context_scope = "global"`` or an explicit ``--global``.
